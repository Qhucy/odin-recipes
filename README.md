# odin-recipes
Recipes from The Odin Project.
This is the first project I am making following Odin's curriculum and it will be the first presentation of basic HTML I have learned.

# What I learned during this project
- Change css properties based on mouse events
- Use strong contrasting colors based on color theory
- Precision with CSS selectors
- Experience with the box model in css
